# Advanced Password Generator & Analyzer

A robust Streamlit application to generate secure passwords and evaluate their strength with detailed analysis and interactive visualizations.

## Features

- **Customizable Password Generation:**  
  Generate passwords with options to include or exclude lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, symbols, and even avoid ambiguous characters.

- **Password Strength Evaluation:**  
  Assess password strength based on length, character diversity, and detection of common weak patterns (e.g., "password", "123456", repeated or sequential characters).

- **Interactive Visualizations:**  
  Visualize strength metrics with Plotly-powered bar charts, radar charts, and scatter plots, providing an intuitive breakdown of password quality.

- **Password History & Recommendations:**  
  Track all generated passwords in session history and receive actionable recommendations to improve overall security.
